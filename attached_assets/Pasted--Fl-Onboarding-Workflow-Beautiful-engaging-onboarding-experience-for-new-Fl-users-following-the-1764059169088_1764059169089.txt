## Files

### Main Components
- `/components/OnboardingScreen.tsx` - Main container managing flow between showcase and setup
- `/components/onboarding/FeatureShowcase.tsx` - Feature carousel (Part 1)
- `/components/onboarding/SetupSteps.tsx` - Setup wizard (Part 2)

### Integration
The onboarding is triggered automatically after login for new users:

```typescript
// In App.tsx
if (showOnboarding) {
  return (
    <OnboardingScreen
      isDark={isDark}
      onComplete={() => setShowOnboarding(false)}
      onSkip={() => setShowOnboarding(false)}
    />
  );
}
```

## Usage

### Triggering Onboarding

**For New Users (Automatic):**
The onboarding automatically shows after successful login for first-time users.

**For Testing/Demo:**
You can manually trigger the onboarding by setting `setShowOnboarding(true)` in the App component, or add a button in the Profile screen.

### Customization

**Feature Showcase:**
Edit the `features` array in `/components/onboarding/FeatureShowcase.tsx`:

```typescript
const features = [
  {
    id: 'unique-id',
    icon: IconComponent, // from lucide-react
    title: 'Feature Title',
    subtitle: 'Feature Subtitle',
    description: 'Detailed description...',
    gradient: 'from-color-500 via-color-500 to-color-500',
    accentColor: 'color-name',
    features: ['Bullet 1', 'Bullet 2', ...] // optional
  },
  // ... more features
];
```

**Setup Steps:**
Modify form fields and validation in `/components/onboarding/SetupSteps.tsx`:
- Add/remove form fields in the profile step
- Customize validation logic in `handleProfileNext()`
- Add new setup steps by creating additional states and conditionals

## Design System

### Gradients
- **Welcome/Primary**: `from-cyan-500 via-blue-500 to-purple-500`
- **Biomarkers**: `from-teal-500 via-emerald-500 to-green-500`
- **AI/Oracle**: `from-purple-500 via-pink-500 to-rose-500`
- **Actions**: `from-orange-500 via-amber-500 to-yellow-500`

### Animations
- **fadeSlideIn**: Elements fade in and slide up (0.4-0.5s)
- **floatPulse**: Icons float and pulse (3s infinite)
- Staggered animations on feature lists (0.1s delay per item)

### Components
- Glass morphism cards with backdrop blur
- Rounded corners (rounded-2xl to rounded-3xl)
- Subtle borders (border-white/10 in dark, border-black/10 in light)
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Progress indicators (dots and bars)

## States & Data

### Form Data Collected
```typescript
// Notifications Step
- notificationsEnabled: boolean
- healthKitEnabled: boolean

// Profile Step (Required)
- name: string
- dateOfBirth: string
- biologicalSex: 'male' | 'female'
- height: string (optional)
- weight: string (optional)

// Blood Work Step
- bloodworkUploaded: boolean

// Optional Scans
- cac: boolean
- dexa: boolean
```

### Completion Flow
1. User completes showcase → moves to setup steps
2. User completes all required setup steps → `onComplete()` called
3. User can skip showcase anytime → moves to setup steps
4. User can skip optional scans → `onComplete()` called
5. `onComplete()` closes onboarding and shows main app
