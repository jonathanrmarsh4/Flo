HealthKit Plugin Installation - Full Explanation
Based on my investigation, here's what's actually happening with the HealthKit integration:

🎯 Current Setup (In Production)
The app DOES NOT use the @healthpilot/healthkit plugin from ios/HealthKitPlugin/ via npm! Instead:

Two Separate Implementations Exist:
ios/HealthKitPlugin/ - A standalone, publishable Capacitor plugin (what we're trying to push to GitHub)
ios/App/App/HealthKitStatsPlugin.swift - The ACTUAL plugin being used in the production app
What's Actually Running:
// client/src/services/healthkit.ts
const Health = registerPlugin<any>('Health');

This registers a plugin called 'Health', but there's no npm package for it! Instead, Capacitor finds it as:
A local plugin embedded directly in the iOS app at ios/App/App/HealthKitStatsPlugin.swift
NOT installed via npm install or package.json
Built directly into the Xcode project
Package.json Entry:
NO ENTRY!

The @healthpilot/healthkit package is NOT in package.json dependencies at all.
🤔 So What Is ios/HealthKitPlugin/ For?
The ios/HealthKitPlugin/ directory appears to be:

A separate/alternative version of the HealthKit plugin
Structured as a proper npm package with package.json
Not currently used in the production app
Perhaps intended for:
Future modularization
Distribution to other projects
A cleaner architecture (separating plugin from app)
📝 If You Were To Install It Via NPM:
If you wanted to publish and use it as a proper npm package, it would be:

# Install from GitHub
npm install git+https://github.com/jonathanrmarsh4/healthpilot-healthkit.git

// package.json entry would be:
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@healthpilot/healthkit": "git+https://github.com/jonathanrmarsh4/healthpilot-healthkit.git"
  }
}

Then you'd run:

npx cap sync ios

Which would add it to the Podfile and integrate it properly.

🎬 Bottom Line:
The current production app uses a direct Swift implementation embedded in the iOS app, NOT an npm package. The ios/HealthKitPlugin/ directory is a separate, standalone plugin that's ready to be published but isn't currently being used.

Does this match your understanding? Should we continue pushing the plugin to GitHub as a standalone package for potential future use? 🤔
